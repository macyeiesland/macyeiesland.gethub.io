        <div><h1>Coffee Tin</h1>
          <p> I picked up this little coffee tin at the One Moto Show, a Portland motorcycle show. It usually takes place in a big empty space that they fill with beautiful bikes, artwork and live music. See See Coffee helps put on this event, this little tin was a collaboration that See See does with Stumptown every year. I am such a sucker for anything physical like this. It now sits on my desk holding my paint pens.</p>
